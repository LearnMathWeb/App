# LearnMath App [BETA]

LearnMath is a website where you can learn mathematics for free. This app will open for you the website faster than before in just a click.

## üìÄ Installation

There are two possible ways to install LearnMath app in your machine:

### Normal:

Download our portable executable file that fits your operating system from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases). Then, extract the file and start `learnmath.exe`

> **‚ìò Supported operating systems:**
>
> Windows 10/11

### Code:

**‚ñ∫ First time running:**

Download the source code using git or from [here](https://github.com/LearnMathWeb/App/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). 

After doing so, make sure to install required dependencies to be able to start or to build the app using this command:

```bash
npm install
```

> This will download and install all dependencies listed in `package.json`. This includes some packages that are needed to build the app that you may not need. If you just want to run the program without building it at all, you can execute `npm install --save-dev electron`

Wait for all packages to be downloaded and installed.

Done! You are ready to open the app!

**‚ñ∫ After installation:**

Execute this following command to start the app:

```bash
npm test
```
